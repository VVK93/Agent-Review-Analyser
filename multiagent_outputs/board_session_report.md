## 💬 Discussion Transcript

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 1
Hi everyone, great to see you all here. To kick things off, what are your initial thoughts on the set of features we're discussing—relocating the like/unlike button, introducing a more affordable Premium tier, and improving playback stability with crash diagnostics? Looking forward to hearing your first impressions.

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
Hi! I think relocating the like/unlike button would be a huge win—right now, it’s way too easy to accidentally tap it while scrolling through my playlists, which can be really frustrating when I’m curating music on the go. The idea of a more affordable Premium tier sounds promising, especially for younger users or people who don’t stream as heavily as I do. As for playback stability and crash diagnostics, that’s essential—nothing kills a vibe faster than interruptions during a work session or commute. Overall, these features seem well-targeted to improving everyday usability and accessibility, which I really appreciate as someone who’s constantly switching between devices and playlists.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jordan, you mentioned the frustration of accidentally hitting the like/unlike button while curating playlists on the go. Can you share more about where you think the button should be placed, or how its design could change to make it less prone to accidental taps?

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
Absolutely. I think the like/unlike button should be a bit more separated from the song title and play controls—maybe smaller or tucked into a dropdown menu instead of being right next to the track name. When I'm scrolling fast, especially on my phone during a commute, it’s easy to hit that heart by mistake and mess up my library. Having the button require a long press or a second tap to confirm liking a song could also help. This would reduce accidental taps without adding too much friction. Since I manage large playlists with hundreds of tracks, small design tweaks like this would make playlist curation way less stressful for me.

#### 👤 Priya Singh
I totally get where Jordan is coming from. For me, the bigger issue is less about accidentally liking songs and more about the overall usability—especially when Spotify glitches during playback, which is super distracting when I'm working or at the gym. But I do agree that making the like button less prominent or requiring a confirmation could help avoid accidental taps. Honestly, I'd rather Spotify focus on fixing core functionality first, like reliable playback over Bluetooth, before tweaking UI elements. When the basics don't work smoothly, those little design annoyances feel even more frustrating.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you mentioned reliable playback over Bluetooth being a bigger concern for you. Can you share more about the specific issues you’ve experienced—like are there connection drops, delays, or something else? That might help us pinpoint which fixes would have the most impact.

#### 👤 Priya Singh
Absolutely, the main problem I face is that Spotify will randomly pause or stop playing when I’m connected to Bluetooth headphones or speakers. Sometimes there’s a delay when I try to resume playback, or it just won’t start again unless I disconnect and reconnect the device. This happens both on my laptop and phone, and it’s really disruptive, especially when I’m in the middle of coding or working out. I expect music to just play smoothly in the background, so these interruptions break my focus and are honestly pretty frustrating. Reliable playback is a must-have for me.

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
I totally get where Priya's coming from. For me, the app crashing and songs not playing through are major issues, especially during study sessions or parties. It's really annoying when you're in the zone or trying to keep a vibe going, and the music just stops. I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times, which is a hassle. Like Priya, I need reliable playback, and these interruptions are a real pain. I rely on Spotify a lot, so I hope they can sort these issues out soon.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Liam, you mentioned uninstalling and reinstalling the app to fix these playback issues. Has that usually resolved the interruptions temporarily, or do the problems always come back after some time?

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
Uninstalling and reinstalling the app usually fixes the issues temporarily, but they tend to come back after a while. It's frustrating because it disrupts my study sessions and parties. I rely on Spotify a lot, so having these interruptions is a real hassle. I hope they can find a more permanent solution soon.

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
I totally get how those interruptions can mess with your flow, Liam. For me, the biggest frustration is not being able to pick specific songs or shuffle my playlists freely with the free version. I mostly use Spotify while studying, and sometimes I just want to listen to a particular song to help me focus. But since Premium feels too expensive for me as a student, I’m stuck with those limits. It’d be great if there were more affordable options that gave students like me more control without breaking the bank.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Emily, you mentioned the need for more affordable options for students that offer better control over what you listen to. If Spotify were to introduce a lower-cost plan with limited song selection features—say, a few on-demand plays per day—would that be appealing to you? Or is full playlist control the main thing you’re looking for?

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
That kind of lower-cost plan with a few on-demand plays per day would definitely be appealing to me. Having even limited control over specific songs would feel like a big upgrade from the free version’s shuffle-only restriction. I’m a college student on a tight budget, so full Premium is a bit out of reach right now. But being able to pick a few songs each day would make studying and relaxing with music more enjoyable without breaking the bank. So, while full playlist control is ideal, a middle ground like that would really help me feel less limited.

#### 👤 Robert Kim
I get where Emily is coming from—having some control over song selection sounds great. For me, though, the biggest issue is the sheer frequency of ads. They interrupt my focus constantly, sometimes after just two songs, which kills my concentration during work. I rely on music to keep my energy up during long hours, and these frequent interruptions just frustrate me. I’d be willing to pay for Premium if it meant fewer or no ads because the constant breaks really reduce my enjoyment. So while song control matters, the ad experience is my main pain point.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Robert, you mentioned that ad interruptions are the biggest challenge for you. If Spotify offered a plan that reduced ad frequency—but didn’t remove them entirely—would that be a meaningful improvement for your listening experience, or is complete ad-free listening essential for you to stay focused?

#### 👤 Robert Kim
Reducing ad frequency would definitely be a step in the right direction, but complete ad-free listening is really what I need to maintain focus. As a small business owner, I rely on music to keep my energy up during long work hours, and even short interruptions break my concentration. Less frequent ads might feel less disruptive, but the fact that they come at all still pulls me out of my flow. So while fewer ads would help, I’d only consider staying with Spotify long-term if they offer a truly uninterrupted experience.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 2
Hi everyone, let’s dive in. Looking at the three features we’re discussing—relocating the like/unlike button, introducing a more affordable Premium tier, and improving playback stability with diagnostic tools—what do you see as the main advantages and potential downsides of each? Who’d like to start us off?

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
I’ll start. Moving the like/unlike button could really cut down on accidental taps—I’ve done that way too often when scrolling through long playlists. The downside might be disrupting muscle memory for longtime users. A more affordable Premium tier sounds great for expanding access, but it risks devaluing the current subscription price. Playback stability improvements with diagnostic tools would be a huge win, especially during late-night work sessions when interruptions kill my flow. However, it might complicate the app for casual users who don’t want tech details. Balancing simplicity with power features is key from my perspective as someone juggling music across devices daily.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jordan, you mentioned that balancing simplicity and power features is important, especially for users juggling music across devices. Could you share any specific tools or interface ideas that might help keep diagnostic features accessible without overwhelming casual listeners?

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
Absolutely. I think a smart, context-sensitive interface that adapts based on user behavior would work well. For example, if I’m just casually browsing on my phone, it could show a simplified view with basic controls. But when I’m managing playlists on my laptop, it could unlock more advanced features like bulk editing or detailed sorting options. This way, diagnostic tools for playlist management or shuffle optimization don’t clutter the experience for casual listeners. Having seamless sync across devices, where my preferences and current mode carry over, would also help keep it powerful yet intuitive. This approach suits my routine since I switch devices frequently and want the right level of control without feeling overwhelmed.

#### 👤 Priya Singh
I agree that adapting the interface to context could help, but my main concern is reliability. Even with a smart UI, if playback keeps pausing—especially over Bluetooth—it ruins the experience for me. I work from home and rely on Spotify for focus, so interruptions are a big deal. I’d rather have fewer features if it meant the app was stable and didn’t introduce new bugs with every update. Jordan’s point about seamless sync is interesting, but for me, it’s more important that Spotify just works consistently, no matter which device I’m on.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you mentioned reliability as your top priority and that you'd trade features for a stable app experience. Can you share if there are specific situations or device types where Spotify's reliability issues stand out most for you?

#### 👤 Priya Singh
Absolutely. The reliability issues are most noticeable when I’m using Spotify over Bluetooth, especially with my wireless headphones or my car’s audio system. Playback will randomly pause or stop, and sometimes I have to restart the app or even disconnect and reconnect the device to get it working again. This is really disruptive, particularly when I’m trying to stay focused during work or keep momentum in a workout. I’d honestly prefer fewer flashy features if it meant the core experience—just playing music reliably—was rock solid. For me, stability on Bluetooth devices is way more important than new updates or experimental features.

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
I totally get what Priya is saying. For me, the app crashes and songs not playing through are the biggest issues. It’s super frustrating when I’m in the middle of a study session or hosting a party, and the music just stops. Like Priya, I’d trade some of the new features for a more stable experience. I’ve had to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times, which is a hassle. Stability is key, especially when you rely on Spotify for both focus and fun.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Liam, you mentioned having to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times. Can you share if that usually fixes the problem long term, or do the crashes and playback issues keep coming back after a while?

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
Uninstalling and reinstalling the app usually provides a temporary fix, but the issues often return after a while. It’s frustrating, especially during study sessions or parties when I need the music to flow smoothly. I rely on Spotify a lot, so these disruptions are a real hassle. It’s like a short-term band-aid rather than a permanent solution.

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
I totally get how frustrating those glitches can be, Liam. For me, the bigger issue with Spotify is the free version’s limitations—I can’t pick specific songs or shuffle playlists the way I want, which feels really restrictive when I’m trying to focus while studying. Since I’m on a tight budget as a college freshman, upgrading to Premium isn’t really an option right now. I wish there were more affordable student-friendly plans that gave us more control without breaking the bank. It’d make my music experience way better and less frustrating overall.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Emily, you mentioned wanting more control without upgrading to Premium—are there specific features from Premium that you wish were available in a more affordable plan, or is it mainly about being able to pick individual songs and shuffle freely?

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
Definitely, the main things I want are the ability to pick specific songs and shuffle playlists how I want. I study a lot, and sometimes I want to listen to a particular song that helps me focus, but with the free version, I’m stuck with whatever Spotify decides to play next. I understand Premium has other perks, but for me, it’s really about having that basic control over my music without paying the full price, which feels steep on a college budget. An affordable student plan with just those features would make a big difference.

#### 👤 Robert Kim
I hear you, Emily, about wanting more control over your playlists. For me, it’s less about skipping songs and more about the constant ads. As a small business owner working long hours, I rely on music to keep my energy up, but the frequent interruptions break my focus and drain my motivation. It’s frustrating that ads pop up every few songs, making it hard to stay in the zone. I understand the free version needs ads, but I wish there was a way to reduce their frequency without paying full price—especially since upgrading feels like the only option to get uninterrupted listening.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Robert, you mentioned that ads disrupt your workflow. If Spotify offered a lower-cost option with fewer ads—but not completely ad-free—would that be appealing, or is uninterrupted listening the most important factor for you?

#### 👤 Robert Kim
A lower-cost option with fewer ads would definitely be more appealing than the current free version. Right now, the ads come so often that it feels like I’m not really getting to enjoy the music, which breaks my focus during work. If Spotify could reduce the frequency of ads, even if it’s not completely ad-free, that would be a big improvement for me. I’m willing to tolerate some ads as long as they don’t interrupt every couple of songs. Since I spend long hours working and rely on music to keep my energy up, having a smoother listening experience without constant interruptions is really important.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 3
Hi everyone, let’s kick things off. Out of the features we’re looking at—improving the like/unlike button, launching a limited Premium tier, and boosting playback stability—which one do you think Spotify should prioritize for next quarter, and what’s your reasoning behind that choice?

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
I believe improving the like/unlike button should be the top priority. As someone who scrolls through large playlists daily, I often accidentally tap the like button, which disrupts my carefully curated libraries. Having a more intentional way to like or unlike tracks would prevent these mistakes and enhance my overall experience. Playback stability is important, but I find it fairly reliable already. The limited Premium tier sounds interesting, but for me, the seamless and frustration-free playlist management is more urgent because it directly impacts how I interact with my music every day.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jordan, you mentioned accidental taps on the like button disrupt your library management. Are there any specific changes or design tweaks you think would make the like/unlike process more intentional and less prone to mistakes?

#### 👤 Jordan Martinez
Absolutely. I’d love to see a confirmation step when liking or unliking a song, like a small pop-up or an “Are you sure?” prompt. Alternatively, making the like button a bit smaller or requiring a longer press would help prevent accidental taps while scrolling through large playlists. For me, managing playlists is central to my daily routine, and those accidental likes clutter my library, making it harder to find the songs I truly want to keep. These simple tweaks would make the experience less frustrating and more controlled.

#### 👤 Priya Singh
I agree that accidental taps can be annoying, but for me, the bigger issue is that even when I intentionally like songs, Spotify’s recommendations don’t seem to get any better. I’d rather see improvements in how my likes actually influence what’s suggested to me. I listen to music while coding and during workouts, so I want recommendations that fit those moods, not just generic hits. Honestly, even if I could avoid accidental likes, it wouldn’t matter much unless the algorithm started feeling more personal.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you mentioned wanting recommendations that match specific activities like coding or working out. How do you currently try to find music for those moods, and is there a feature you wish Spotify had to make this process easier for you?

#### 👤 Priya Singh
Right now, I usually search for playlists with keywords like “coding focus” or “workout motivation,” but honestly, it’s hit or miss. I end up skipping a lot of tracks that don’t fit the vibe I’m after. I wish Spotify had a smarter feature where I could select my current activity—like a “Working” or “Exercising” mode—and it would automatically adapt recommendations based on what I’ve liked in those contexts before. That would save me time and help me stay in the zone, especially since interruptions really break my concentration.

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
#### 🎤 Liam O'Sullivan

I totally get where Priya is coming from. I often build playlists for studying or parties, and it's frustrating when the vibe isn't right. A feature that adapts to specific activities based on past preferences would be a game-changer. It would definitely help during study marathons when I need to stay focused without having to skip tracks. Plus, it might prevent those annoying app crashes if I’m not constantly switching playlists.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Liam, you mentioned building playlists for different activities like studying or parties. Are there specific cues or attributes—like tempo, genre, or even lyrics—that help you decide what fits each vibe, and how do you think Spotify could better recognize those differences automatically?

#### 👤 Liam O'Sullivan
For study playlists, I lean towards instrumental or mellow tracks—something with a steady tempo that won't distract me. For parties, it's all about upbeat, energetic songs with catchy hooks. It'd be great if Spotify could better recognize these vibes and suggest songs based on tempo and mood. Maybe an AI feature that learns my preferences over time would help. This way, I wouldn’t have to manually sift through tracks, especially when the app's been glitchy.

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
I totally get where you’re coming from, Liam. For me, studying with music is about having control over what I listen to, but the free version of Spotify limits that since I can’t pick specific songs or reshuffle as much as I want. An AI that learns my preferences sounds amazing, especially if it could help me find playlists that fit my mood without needing Premium. Right now, the cost of Premium is just too high for me as a student, so I’m stuck with those restrictions, which can be frustrating when I want a specific vibe while studying or relaxing.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Emily, you mentioned the challenge of finding playlists that fit your mood without Premium access. If Spotify offered more personalized playlist recommendations on the free version, would that make the experience significantly better for you, or are there other limitations that feel just as important?

#### 👤 Emily Zhao
Definitely, more personalized playlist recommendations on the free version would be a big help. It would make discovering music that fits my mood easier without needing Premium. But honestly, the biggest limitation for me is still not being able to pick specific songs or reshuffle freely. When I’m studying or just relaxing, I want more control over what I hear, and that restriction feels really limiting. So while better recommendations would improve the experience, having more control over playback on the free tier would make the biggest difference for my daily use.

#### 👤 Robert Kim
I hear what you’re saying, Emily. For me, the biggest issue isn’t just control over playback but the sheer number of ads interrupting the flow. I use Spotify to keep my energy up while working long hours, but when ads pop up after only a couple of songs, it kills my focus. I end up losing momentum, which is frustrating. While I appreciate the free service, these frequent commercial breaks make it hard to enjoy or stay productive. If Spotify could reduce the ad frequency or length, I might stick with free longer without feeling pressured to upgrade.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Robert, you mentioned that frequent ads break your focus while working. If you could change one thing about how ads are presented—like their timing, type, or frequency—what would make the biggest positive impact for you?

#### 👤 Robert Kim
If I could change one thing, it would be to space out ads much more—maybe after every 5 or 6 songs instead of just 2 or 3. The current frequency is brutal when I’m trying to stay in the zone running my business. I don’t mind ads themselves, but when they come so often, it pulls me out of concentration and kills the flow. Since I spend long hours working and rely on music to keep energy up, these constant interruptions feel like a real productivity drain. If Spotify could reduce ad frequency or offer shorter ads, I might reconsider upgrading, but as it is now, it’s just too disruptive.

Proceed with improving playback stability and crash diagnostics as the top priority, ensuring changes are intuitive and non-intrusive for all user types. Consider piloting a more affordable Premium tier with carefully balanced limitations (e.g., reduced ads, limited song selection) to address the needs of students and light users. Relocate or redesign the like/unlike button only if it can be done without significantly disrupting existing user habits, and pair it with optional confirmation to minimize accidental taps. Prioritize stability and core listening experience above UI or monetization tweaks, as this was the strongest and most universal user concern.
