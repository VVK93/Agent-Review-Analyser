- **Sample Feedback**:
  > Turns out Spotify leadership has a spine after all. Principles matter these days, and I refuse to give my patronage to communists. Spotify stood for free speech by refusing to remove voices, and that counts for something. Wish they would go all in, refuse to put propaganda labels on content, but I understand they do have to protect their business on these commie app stores. Overall, good job Spotify.
  > The play portion of spotify just disappears on a regular basis. The only way i can get it to return is to shut down the app and restart it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue comes back immediately. Recently songs and podcasts also just stop playing. I have to go in and hit play to get them going again. That is if the play section is working. If not, it's restart the app. System stability has been a real issue lately.

### Cluster 7

  > I love this app! One downside - the free version doesn't allow you to pick or reshuffle, and the Premium is stupid expensive. I can't afford ten bucks a month. Oh well. I'll deal with that. Other than those two things, it's awesome!
  > Lost of small bugs and glitches, the app is almost useless to use without premium and some features are hard to use. Even with premium it's quite bad. When I started using the app years ago I would've gave it a 4 - 5 star rating as you could use the free version of the app much more freely, there weren't many bugs and the app was overall just better.

## 💬 Discussion Transcript

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 1
Hi everyone, let’s kick things off. What are your initial thoughts on the features we’re considering—expanding lyrics availability and language support, a more affordable Premium Lite plan, and improved offline mode stability, especially for Android?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
Expanding lyrics availability and language support is honestly my top priority! I listen to a lot of international music, and it’s frustrating when I can’t find lyrics—especially for Hindi or Korean songs. A more affordable Premium Lite plan sounds great for students like me who want to skip ads but maybe don’t need all the premium features. Also, improved offline mode stability would be a huge relief. Sometimes my downloads don’t play properly when I’m on the train, which is super annoying. Overall, these features would make Spotify way more enjoyable and useful for me, especially as someone who loves learning languages through music.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you mentioned that missing lyrics, especially for Hindi and Korean songs, is a key issue for you. Can you share how often this impacts your listening experience, and whether it affects your decision to use Spotify over other music apps?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
Definitely, this happens to me pretty often—at least a few times a week. I listen to a lot of Hindi and Korean tracks, and when the lyrics aren’t available, it’s honestly disappointing. Sometimes, I’ll even switch to YouTube just to find a lyric video, especially if I’m trying to learn the song or understand the meaning. While I still prefer Spotify overall for playlists and recommendations, the lack of lyrics for my favorite songs does make me consider other apps occasionally. For me, being able to follow along with the words really helps with language learning and makes the music feel more personal.

#### 👤 David Martinez
I totally get where Priya's coming from. While I focus more on podcasts, I can relate to the importance of having all the features we need in one place. For me, it's about having a smoother experience with podcast discovery and navigation on Spotify. Sometimes, finding new podcasts or managing subscriptions becomes a bit of a hassle. Still, Spotify remains my go-to because of its diverse content and the ease of sharing episodes with friends. Having everything streamlined would make it even better.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
David, you mentioned that managing podcast subscriptions can be a hassle on Spotify. Could you share a specific example of where the process gets cumbersome for you or what changes might make it more user-friendly?

#### 👤 David Martinez
Managing podcast subscriptions can get tricky when I try to organize my episode lists. For example, if I want to prioritize new episodes from multiple shows, it’s a bit of a juggle. A more intuitive playlist feature specifically for podcasts would help. If I could easily sort and categorize episodes like I can with music, it’d streamline my listening experience. As someone who spends a lot of time commuting, having a smoother navigation system would make a big difference.

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
For me, the biggest struggle isn’t with podcasts, but with offline music. I travel a lot for work—sometimes to places where there’s no signal at all. It’s frustrating when songs I’ve downloaded suddenly won’t play, or when the app glitches and I lose access to my playlists. I wish Spotify was more reliable with downloads and syncing, especially across my devices. Music isn’t just background noise for me; it’s how I get inspired on shoots and flights, so these issues really disrupt my flow.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jenna, you mentioned issues with downloads and syncing across your devices. Could you share if you’ve noticed these problems are worse on certain devices or if it happens regardless of whether you’re using your phone, tablet, or computer?

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
Yeah, I’ve noticed the issues are definitely worse on my Android phone, which I use the most when traveling. Sometimes songs I’ve downloaded just won’t play offline, even though they’re marked as available. On my laptop, syncing tends to lag but it’s less glitchy overall. It’s really frustrating when I’m on a shoot in a remote area and suddenly can’t access the music I need. For me, the mobile experience is the biggest pain point because that’s when I rely on Spotify the most.

#### 👤 Marcus Green
I feel you, Jenna. For me, the mobile experience is frustrating too, but mostly because of the constant ads that interrupt my flow. Since I use Spotify free on my phone while studying or working out, the frequent ads break my concentration and motivation. I don’t have the option to skip tracks, which makes it harder to stay in the zone. I understand syncing issues can be a pain, but for me, the interruptions are the biggest barrier to enjoying music seamlessly on mobile. Being budget-conscious, I’m not ready to upgrade yet, so I just try to work around these limitations.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Marcus, you mentioned working around the limitations of the free version. Are there specific features or adjustments—besides removing ads—that would make the free mobile experience significantly better for you?

#### 👤 Marcus Green
One big improvement would be more control over playback. Being able to skip more than just a few tracks or choose songs on demand would help a lot. Also, better playlist customization options on mobile would be great—right now, it feels very limited. Ads are the main issue, but these restrictions make it harder to enjoy music during study or workouts. Since I’m on a tight budget, these small changes could make the free version feel less frustrating without needing to upgrade. It’s about making the experience smoother and less interrupted, which would help me stay focused and motivated.

#### 👤 Linda Foster
I completely relate to what Marcus said about playback control. As a busy mom, I often rely on Spotify during workouts or to entertain my kids, and not being able to skip tracks freely on the free version can be frustrating. The Premium subscription feels a bit pricey for our family budget, so I sometimes stick with the free version despite its limits. Also, I’ve had some issues with logging in and app updates, which adds to the hassle. Convenience is key for me, so any improvements that make the app easier to manage and less restrictive would really enhance my experience.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Linda, you mentioned having issues with logging in and app updates. Can you share a bit more about those challenges—what specifically makes them inconvenient for you, and do they affect how often you use Spotify?

#### 👤 Linda Foster
Sure! The login issues usually happen when I forget my password or the app glitches after an update, making me reset everything. It’s frustrating because I’m often short on time between work and family, so these hiccups disrupt my quick access to music. The app updates sometimes take longer than expected or don’t install smoothly, which means I can’t use Spotify right away. This definitely makes me less inclined to open the app, especially when I just want to relax or entertain my kids without hassle. Convenience is key for me, so these technical problems really affect my overall experience.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 2
Hi everyone, let’s dive right in. Looking at the three Spotify features on our list—expanded lyrics coverage, a more affordable Premium Lite plan, and improved offline mode on Android—what do you see as the main pros and cons of each? 

Feel free to touch on user experience, technical challenges, or any other angles you think are important. Who’d like to start?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
I’ll start! Expanded lyrics coverage is a huge pro for me—I love singing along and understanding songs, especially in different languages. The main con is probably the technical work needed to get accurate, synced lyrics for so many tracks, especially regional ones. 

A more affordable Premium Lite plan would help students like me, but I’d worry about which features get cut—if lyrics or downloads are limited, that’s a drawback. 

Improved offline mode on Android sounds great for when I’m commuting or have patchy internet, but it might be tricky to make it seamless across all devices and playlists. 

Overall, expanded lyrics would impact my daily experience the most.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you mentioned that expanded lyrics coverage would impact your daily experience the most. Are there any specific languages or music genres where you feel this feature is especially lacking or would be particularly valuable for you?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
Definitely! For me, the biggest gap is with Hindi and regional Indian songs—like Marathi and Tamil tracks. I listen to a lot of Bollywood and indie music, and it’s frustrating when lyrics just aren’t available or aren’t synced properly. It’s even more noticeable with K-pop and some Spanish tracks I use to practice languages. Having full, accurate lyrics for these genres would make singing along and understanding the meaning so much easier, especially since I love learning through music. It would really help me connect more deeply with the songs and improve my language skills at the same time.

#### 👤 David Martinez
I totally get where Priya's coming from about lyrics. While I focus more on podcasts, I’ve faced similar frustrations. Navigating and discovering new podcasts could be more intuitive, especially for non-English content. I love sharing episodes with friends, but finding specific ones can be tricky. Improving this could expand my listening experience, just like accurate lyrics would for Priya. Plus, having a more organized system for managing podcast subscriptions and episodes would be a game changer for my long commutes.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
David, you mentioned the challenge of discovering and managing non-English podcasts. Could you share what kind of organization features or filters would make it easier for you to find and keep track of the episodes you’re interested in?

#### 👤 David Martinez
I’d love to see improved filtering options, like sorting by language and region, to discover non-English podcasts more easily. A feature that suggests episodes based on my listening habits or popular shows in different languages would be great too. Plus, a better way to organize my subscriptions, like customizable folders or tags, would help manage my growing list. As someone who enjoys diverse content during my commutes, these tools would make navigating my library much smoother.

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
I definitely relate to wanting better organization, but for me, the main issue is with offline reliability. As someone who's often traveling or shooting in places without stable internet, it's so frustrating when my downloaded playlists suddenly won't play. I just need music to work when I need it, no matter where I am. Also, syncing between my phone and laptop isn't seamless—sometimes downloads disappear or don't update, which disrupts my workflow. So, for me, stability and dependable offline access matter more than discovery features right now.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jenna, could you share more about what an ideal offline mode would look like for you? Are there specific improvements—like clearer download status indicators or automatic re-syncing—that would make using Spotify on the go less frustrating?

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
Absolutely. For me, an ideal offline mode would first guarantee that every downloaded song actually plays—no mysterious errors or “not available” messages when I’m in the air or out of signal. I’d really appreciate clearer indicators showing which tracks are 100% ready for offline, not just “in progress” or stuck. Automatic re-syncing when I’m back online would be a lifesaver, so my playlists stay updated without me having to babysit the app. Since I’m often between shoots or airports, I need to trust that my music’s there when I hit play—no exceptions. The current unpredictability just adds unnecessary stress to my travel days.

#### 👤 Marcus Green
I totally get what Jenna’s saying about offline mode needing reliability—having music fail to play when you’re offline is super frustrating. For me, the biggest issue is not just offline playback but how ads constantly interrupt my listening, especially when I’m trying to focus on studying or working out. The ads break my flow and often repeat the same ones, which makes the experience annoying. Plus, I don’t have control over skipping tracks, so I feel stuck sometimes. I’m not ready to pay for Premium yet, so I try to make the best of free, but these interruptions really take away from enjoying music fully.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Marcus, you mentioned that the frequency and repetition of ads really disrupt your listening flow. If you could adjust how ads appear or interact with them in the free version, what changes would make your Spotify experience feel less intrusive?

#### 👤 Marcus Green
If I could change how ads work, I’d want fewer ads overall and more variety so I’m not hearing the same ones over and over. Maybe Spotify could let me choose ad categories I’m interested in, so they feel less annoying and more relevant. Also, having the option to skip ads after a few seconds would be a game-changer. As a college student trying to focus while studying or working out, constant interruptions make it hard to stay in the zone. I’m not ready to pay for Premium yet, so these tweaks would really help me enjoy music without feeling like I’m being bombarded.

#### 👤 Linda Foster
I completely get what Marcus is saying about ads being repetitive and distracting. For me, as a busy mum juggling work and family, the ads can be frustrating, especially when I just want to quickly relax or entertain my kids with music. I like the idea of choosing ad categories—it could make the experience feel more personal and less annoying. However, I also find Spotify Premium a bit pricey, so I understand why Marcus hasn’t upgraded yet. If the free version had fewer interruptions or more control over ads, it would make a big difference for users like me who want convenience without the extra cost.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Linda, you mentioned finding Spotify Premium a bit pricey and valuing convenience. If Spotify offered a lower-cost option with reduced ads or more ad control—rather than going fully ad-free—would that be something you’d consider? Why or why not?

#### 👤 Linda Foster
Yes, I would definitely consider a lower-cost option with fewer ads or more control over them. As a busy working mum, I appreciate convenience and simplicity, so having some flexibility without paying full Premium price sounds ideal. Sometimes I just want to quickly play music or playlists without interruptions, but I’m not always willing to commit to a higher subscription fee. A more affordable middle ground would help me enjoy Spotify more regularly, especially when relaxing or entertaining my kids without the frustration of constant ads. It feels like a practical compromise that fits my budget and lifestyle better.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Round 3
Hi everyone! Let’s kick things off:  
Of the three features we've outlined, which one do you think Spotify should prioritize and ship in the next quarter—and can you share why you picked that particular feature?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
I think Spotify should prioritize expanding the lyrics feature to cover more songs, especially in non-English languages. For me, music is a big part of how I learn and connect with new languages, and it’s honestly disappointing when my favorite Hindi or Korean tracks don’t have lyrics available. Having more complete lyric coverage would make the app way more useful—not just for singing along, but also for understanding and appreciating the songs on a deeper level. This would really enhance my daily listening and study sessions, and I’m sure a lot of other users feel the same way.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Priya, you highlighted that expanded lyrics would help users learn and appreciate songs in different languages. Are there any specific features or improvements—like real-time translation or pronunciation guides—that you think could further support this experience?

#### 👤 Priya Ramesh
Absolutely! I’d love to see real-time translation alongside the lyrics, so I can understand the meaning as I listen—especially for songs in Korean or Spanish, which I’m trying to learn. A pronunciation guide would be super helpful too, maybe with phonetic spellings or even audio snippets for tricky words. Sometimes I want to sing along accurately, not just mumble the sounds! These features would make it much easier to connect with the music and pick up new languages naturally. For me, music is a big part of how I study and relax, so anything that helps bridge the language gap would be amazing.

#### 👤 David Martinez
I really like Priya's idea about real-time translation and phonetic guides. While my focus is more on podcasts, I can see how these features would enhance music learning. As someone who spends a lot of time commuting, having intuitive podcast navigation is crucial for me. I often struggle to manage subscriptions and find exclusive content. Improving these areas would make my experience even better, helping me discover and share new shows with friends.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
David, you mentioned challenges with managing podcast subscriptions and finding exclusive content. Can you walk us through what makes this process difficult for you, and if there are any specific features you think would simplify podcast discovery and sharing?

#### 👤 David Martinez
Navigating podcast subscriptions feels clunky compared to music. I often lose track of new episodes or exclusive content that I want to dig into. A more intuitive way to organize subscriptions would be helpful—maybe smart folders or better tagging options. Also, a recommendation system that learns my preferences over time would simplify discovery. Sharing could be enhanced with curated lists I can easily send to friends. As someone who spends a lot of time commuting, these changes would make managing my podcast library much smoother.

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
Honestly, my main gripe isn’t with podcasts, but I get where David’s coming from. For me, it's the music side—especially offline access—that's a mess. I travel a lot for shoots, often without stable internet, and sometimes songs I’ve downloaded just refuse to play. When syncing fails between my phone and laptop, it throws off my whole workflow. I wish Spotify would focus on making the basics—like reliable downloads and seamless syncing—rock solid. That’s way more important for someone like me, who depends on music to get through unpredictable days.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Jenna, you mentioned syncing issues between your phone and laptop causing problems with offline access. Could you share what an ideal syncing experience would look like for you on Spotify, especially when you're on the move?

#### 👤 Jenna Lee
Ideally, syncing should be completely seamless and automatic. If I download a playlist on my laptop, I want it to instantly show up as available offline on my phone, without me having to manually redownload or troubleshoot missing tracks. When I’m traveling and have limited internet, it’s frustrating when songs I thought were synced suddenly won’t play. For me, music is a lifeline during long flights or remote shoots. I’d love a system where both my devices just “know” what’s downloaded and stay in sync, even with spotty connections—so I never have to worry about losing access to my playlists when I need them most.

#### 👤 Marcus Green
I get what you mean, Jenna, but as a free-tier user like me, syncing offline isn’t even an option, which is frustrating. I rely on Spotify mostly while studying or working out, and the constant ads break my flow. Even if syncing worked perfectly, I’d still be interrupted by ads that pop up way too often and repeat a lot. I’m not ready to pay for Premium yet, so I just try to make the best of the free version, but it feels limiting. Your seamless sync idea sounds great for Premium users, but for me, the biggest pain is the ads and lack of control over playback.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Marcus, you mentioned feeling limited by ads and a lack of playback control on the free tier. If you could improve just one aspect of the free experience—fewer ads, better playlist control, or something else—which would make the biggest difference for you?

#### 👤 Marcus Green
Honestly, fewer ads would be the biggest improvement for me. As a college student, I often use Spotify while studying or working out, and the constant interruptions really break my focus. The ads not only come too frequently but also tend to repeat and aren’t relevant to me, which makes them even more frustrating. Better playlist control would be nice, but I can manage with the current limitations if I didn’t have to deal with so many ads. Cutting down on ads would make the free experience way more enjoyable and less distracting, especially when I’m trying to stay in the zone.

#### 👤 Linda Foster
I understand where Marcus is coming from about the ads—they can be really distracting, especially when you’re trying to focus. For me, the bigger issue is the cost of the Premium subscription. As a busy working mom, I’d love the convenience of ad-free listening and full playlist control, but the price feels steep on top of all our other expenses. Plus, I sometimes struggle with managing my account and app updates, which adds to the hassle. I want an easy, affordable way to enjoy music without interruptions or technical headaches, especially when I’m using Spotify to relax or keep the kids entertained.

### 🎤 Facilitator – Follow-up
Linda, you mentioned that managing your account and dealing with app updates can be a hassle. Can you share more about what specific challenges you face with those aspects, and how Spotify could make those areas easier for you?

#### 👤 Linda Foster
Sure! One challenge I often face is when I forget my password or get logged out unexpectedly—I find the recovery process a bit confusing and time-consuming, especially when I’m juggling work and family. Also, app updates sometimes disrupt my playlists or settings, which is frustrating when I just want to relax or entertain my kids quickly. Spotify could improve by making account recovery more straightforward and offering clearer notifications about updates, maybe with an option to delay them. For me, simplicity and reliability are key because I don’t have much time to troubleshoot tech issues between my busy schedule.

## 📝 Meeting Summary

# Spotify User Board Meeting Summary

- **Ad Frustration:** Marcus and Linda (and to some extent, others) agree that frequent, repetitive ads in the free tier are highly disruptive.
- **Offline Reliability:** Jenna’s pain with unreliable offline mode is echoed by others who value dependable access, especially on mobile.
- **Need for Affordable Options:** General support for a mid-tier (Lite) plan that balances features and cost.

**Disagreement:**
- **Feature Prioritization:** Priya prioritizes lyrics, Jenna prioritizes offline stability, Marcus/Linda focus on ads and affordability—reflecting different primary pain points.
- **Podcast vs. Music Focus:** David’s podcast-centric perspective means his priorities (discovery/organization) diverge from the music/offline/ads concerns of others.

## 4. **Final Recommendation**

**Conditional Go:**  
Prioritize expanding lyrics coverage (especially for non-English/regional tracks) in the next quarter, as it offers the broadest daily impact and aligns with strong user demand. However, improvements to offline mode stability on Android should be addressed in parallel, given the severe pain points for mobile users. The Premium Lite plan should be explored with careful feature selection to avoid undermining full Premium value; ensure that essential features (like lyrics and some offline access) are retained to justify the upgrade for budget-conscious users.
